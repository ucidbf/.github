## Overview

**Design Build Fly (DBF)** is an annual competition hosted by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). The 2025 mission challenges teams to design, build, and test a vaccine delivery aircraft that meets specific mission profiles. This year, the focus is on the **X-1 test vehicle**, a glider capable of autonomous flight, which must be launched from our aircraft.

The competition will take place from 10 - 13 April 2025, at location TBD.

## Goals and Objectives

Our objective is to design and build an electric-powered, remotely controlled aircraft that can successfully carry and deploy payloads according to the competition rules. The aircraft must be capable of launching the X-1 test vehicle while adhering to strict specifications for external and internal fuel tanks.

### Missions

1. **Flight Mission 1: Deployment Flight**
   - **Payload**: None.
   - The aircraft must complete three laps within a 5-minute flight window.

2. **Flight Mission 2: Staging Flight**
   - **Payload**: X-1 test vehicle and fuel tanks.
   - The aircraft must carry at least two external fuel tanks (commercial beverage bottles) and complete three laps as quickly as possible within a 5-minute flight window.

3. **Flight Mission 3: Vaccine Delivery Flight**
   - **Payload**: X-1 test vehicle and fuel tanks.
   - The aircraft must launch the X-1 test vehicle from 200-400 feet AGL, ensuring it transitions to stable flight, executes a 180-degree turn, and lands in designated bonus boxes for additional points. The aircraft must deliver the required payload within a 10-minute flight window.

4. **Ground Mission: Operational Demonstration**
   - A timed mission demonstrating the transition from Mission 2 to Mission 3 payloads.

The ultimate goal is to achieve the best overall score by successfully completing all mission requirements.
